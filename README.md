# Markdown-CheatSheet

At some point in the current company, it was decided we need to rewrite our product documentation.
Make it more global and straightforward.

We needed to learn markdown as we were asked to write new documentation in this markup language. 

I decided to make a handy cheatsheet with explanation and what is more important with a "copy to clipboard" button to make the life of my co-workers much easier. 

This was my very first personal project and I used basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
